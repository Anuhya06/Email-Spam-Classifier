# Email-Spam-Classifier
An email spam classifier is a type of model or system designed to automatically categorize incoming emails as either spam or ham. The goal is to filter out unwanted and potentially harmful messages, allowing users to focus on genuine and important emails. 
# Feature Extraction
Convert the text content of emails into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms. Common approaches include the Bag-of-Words model, TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), and word embeddings. This step transforms the email content into a numerical representation that can be used by machine learning models.
# Data Pre-processing
Preprocess the data to remove noise, irrelevant information, and ensure consistency. This may involve tasks such as removing stop words, stemming or lemmatization, and handling special characters.
# Training and Testing
Train the selected machine learning model using the labeled dataset. During training, the model learns patterns and features indicative of spam and ham emails.Assess the performance of the trained model using a separate test dataset.
